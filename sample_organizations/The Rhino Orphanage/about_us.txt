THE RHINO ORPHANAGE
The Rhino Orphanage is a registered non-profit company based in the Limpopo Province and was founded by Arrie van Deventer in 2012. The orphanage is the first specialist, dedicated, non-commercial centre that cares for orphaned and injured baby rhinos with the only aim of releasing them back into the wild. It was created as the result of a lack of a specialized place for rearing baby rhinos who have been orphaned as a consequence of the current poaching crisis which feeds the illegal trade in horns.

THE RHINO ORPHANAGE
Baby rhinos are hand-reared by the rehabilitation staff, a milk substitute is fed as well as supplementary food. Exercise is encouraged by daily walks in which the rhinos also have the opportunity to graze and browse in the bush. The rhinos are split in groups according to ages and how depending they are on their human moms. Natural behaviour such as playing and wallowing are highly encouraged and are developed normally if rhinos are socialized with other rhinos. Health checks, diets and medical problems are treated by specialized veterinary staff. Human contact is restricted to prevent the imprinting of rhinos to humans and in the future turn them into problem animals when in adulthood.
