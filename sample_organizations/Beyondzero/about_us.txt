Launched in January 2014 by Her Excellency Margaret Kenyatta the First Lady of the Republic of Kenya, Beyond Zero was inspired by the realization and knowledge that maternal and children deaths are preventable. Beyond Zero is a call to action for policy prioritization and formulation, increased resource allocation, improved service delivery and better individual health seeking behaviors and practices. Through this high level advocacy platform, the First Lady leverages on the convening power to bring to focus key challenges facing Kenyans and build strategic partnerships that will address these challenges. Beyond Zero is a charitable organization.
