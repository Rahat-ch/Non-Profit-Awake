Mission
Our mission is to work with volunteers from around the world. Volunteers assist impoverished rural communities in West Africa with solutions-oriented projects that will enable local people to lift themselves out of poverty. We focus on empowering people, particularly young and disadvantaged groups, so that they can become agents of proactive change within their communities.

Objectives:

Our objectives are aligned to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) initiated by the United Nations from 2016.
